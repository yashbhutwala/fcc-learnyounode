You do not need to make your own test file.","","----------------------------------------------------------------------","## HINTS","","To perform a filesystem operation you are going to need the `fs` module from the Node core library. To load this kind of module, or any other \"global\" module, use the following incantation:","","```js","var fs = require('fs')","```","","Now you have the full `fs` module available in a variable named `fs`.","","All synchronous (or blocking) filesystem methods in the `fs` module end with 'Sync'. To read a file, you'll need to use `fs.readFileSync('/path/to/file')`. This method will *return* a `Buffer` object containing the complete contents of the file.","","Documentation on the `fs` module can be found by pointing your browser here:","  {rootdir:/node_apidoc/fs.html}","","`Buffer` objects are Node's way of efficiently representing arbitrary arrays of data, whether it be ascii, binary or some other format. `Buffer` objects can be converted to strings by simply calling the `toString()` method on them. e.g. `var str = buf.toString()`.","","Documentation on `Buffer`s can be found by pointing your browser here:","  {rootdir:/node_apidoc/buffer.html}","","If you're looking for an easy way to count the number of newlines in a string, recall that a JavaScript `String` can be `.split()` into an array of substrings and that '\\n' can be used as a delimiter. Note that the test file does not have a newline character ('\\n') at the end of the last line, so using this method you'll end up with an array that has one more element than the number of newlines."],"id":1}]]},"ace":{"folds":[],"scrolltop":253,"scrollleft":1979,"selection":{"start":{"row":25,"column":398},"end":{"row":25,"column":398},"isBackwards":false},"options":{"guessTabSize":true,"useWrapMode":false,"wrapToView":true},"firstLineState":{"row":14,"state":"allowBlock","mode":"ace/mode/markdown"}},"timestamp":1493829433130,"hash":"392a3bb8ad690e1a902103d742c9d00df102ee46"}
