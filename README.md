Going through the [learnyounode](https://github.com/workshopper/learnyounode) tutorials as part of [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/start-a-nodejs-server)'s Back End Development Certification.

Putting the solutions here so I can revisit them for reference.

In order to run, first install learnyounode using `npm install -g learnyounode`. Then, run `learnyounode`, select an activity, and to verify my solution run: `learnyounode verify {fileLocation}`.
